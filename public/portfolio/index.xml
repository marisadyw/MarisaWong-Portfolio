      <description>Project Description One Health is the multisectoral and collaborative approach to achieving the best health outcomes for humans, animals, and the shared environment (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022). This approach is relevant and necessary at all government levels to ensure that appropriate specialists represent their area of expertise in complex, transboundary health issues. On the other hand, rapid response teams (RRTs) are designated personnel who are trained, equipped, and ready to deploy at any public health emergency.</description>

      <description>Project Description For a final project, my group and I conducted a risk assessment of Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation&amp;rsquo;s Superfund Site in San Jose, California. The site was home to an electronics and semiconductor fabrication plant from 1977 to 1983. Sources of hazards include solvents containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as 1,1,1-TCA; TCE; 1,1-DCE; and Acetone; which were discovered in 1981 to have been released into the environment through a fractured pipeline.</description>

Project Description Diarrheal disease is a major cause of global morbidity and mortality in low and middle income countries, and one of the leading causes of enteric disease is Campylobacter infections. Campylobacter is commonly transmitted to humans through the ingestion of contaminated food and water; however, further evidence suggests animal encounters may play a substantial role in transmitting the pathogen.</description>
