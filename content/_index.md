Hello! Thanks for visiting my online portfolio :)

I'm Marisa Wong, an Epidemiologist and Environmental Health Professional based out of Atlanta, GA, USA.

I recently graduated from Emory University with my Master of Public Health (MPH) degree, concentrating in Environmental Health and focusing in Epidemiology.

I'm eager to make an impact on public health through epidemiological analyses, disease surveillance, program evaluation, and environmental health!

If you're interested in any of my projects or experience, contact me at marisadyw@gmail.com.
