I'm an Epidemiologist and Environmental Health Professional. I'm originally from California, where I spent my early career learning about local environmental requirements. I relocated to Atlanta, GA to pursue my dream of obtaining an MPH and working at the CDC.

Education

Master of Public Health (MPH), Environmental Health (focus in Epidemiology)
  Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, Atlanta, GA

Bachelor of Science (BS), Majors: Public Health Science & Environmental Science, Minors: Biology & Sustainability
  Santa Clara University College of Arts and Sciences, Santa Clara, CA

Professional Interests

My passion lies at the intersection of protecting the environment and protecting public health, and I believe the environment is the most important determinant of our health. My career began in hazardous materials, so I have a developed interest in risk assessment, site investigations, and environmental compliance. As I explored my graduate education, those interests began to diversify.

Climate change is the root of so many environmental issues, and one that is particularly interesting to me is the relationship between human migration/development and infectious disease ecology. As climate change creates an increased risk of natural disasters and alters food production patterns, climate migrants are forced to chart new territory and expose themselves to new ecological vectors that transmit disease.

I'm a proponent of using the One Health concept to further our knowledge and problem solving ability, and I'd like Environmental Health to have a greater weight in this conversation.

Goals

1. I aspire to make a lasting impact on public health and environmental preservation impact by empowering others to make data-driven decisions that affect population health by conducting research, analyzing results, communicating findings, and providing expertise. 
2. I strive to continue learning by growing both my technical and people-oriented skills to become a well-rounded and well-informed public health professional. 
3. I aim to obtain a full-time position at the Federal level, where I believe I can best serve public in the pursuit of health quality.
