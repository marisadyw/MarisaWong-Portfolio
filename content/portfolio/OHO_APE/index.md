#### Project Description
One Health is the multisectoral and collaborative approach to achieving the best health outcomes for humans, animals, and the shared environment (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022). This approach is relevant and necessary at all government levels to ensure that appropriate specialists represent their area of expertise in complex, transboundary health issues. On the other hand, rapid response teams (RRTs) are designated personnel who are trained, equipped, and ready to deploy at any public health emergency. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) One Health Office (OHO) and Emergency Response Capacity Team (ERCT) are collaborating to conduct a scoping literature review of One Health Rapid Response Teams (OH-RRTs). This review intends to gather further insight on frameworks, best practices, and established OH-RRTs to inform best practices for One Health coordination during emergency responses.

I led the determination of inclusion and exclusion criteria, title and abstract screening, and variable specification for full-text review. I began to contribute to full-text review before returning back to school in Fall 2022.

This project served as my [Applied Practice Experience](https://sph.emory.edu/rollins-life/community-engaged-learning/ape/index.html) for my MPH degree.
