#### Project Description
For the final project of Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology (EH 530), my group and I prepared a project proposal consisting of a robust epidemiologic analysis to determine the relationship between ozone pollution, asthma hospitalizations, and IgE biomarker levels in adolescents living in Los Angeles, CA. 

##### Abstract
The concern over air pollution continues to rise along with the onset of global climate change. One of the major sources of air pollution is ozone in the troposphere. Ozone does not
naturally occur at the ground level, but it is the result of other gaseous mixtures in our atmosphere. The primary sources of ozone emissions include cars and industrial manufacturers. The presence of high ozone concentrations accompanies the hazards of extreme heat; thus, it is
common to have dangerous levels of ozone on warm sunny days (Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). Los Angeles, California is known for its dense urban population and extreme weather (including drought, heat, and wildfires); as a result, Los Angeles, CA will serve as the location of interest where the source population will be selected.

Areas with increased air pollution have higher likelihoods of respiratory disease prevalence. One of the most commonly studied respiratory illnesses related to ozone exposure is
childhood asthma. Children are a specific target for asthma due to their developing lungs that are vulnerable to damage at a young age. While this relationship is often investigated, it ignores the adolescent age group and their risk of the body’s respiratory response to hazardous levels of ozone. The need for research on adolescents is crucial for further understanding how their lungs develop and how asthma symptoms affect their growth, education, and social interactions.

Our research team is interested in studying the association between ground-level ozone exposure and the immunoglobulin E (IgE) biomarker’s response to this exposure through asthma
related-hospitalizations in adolescents aged thirteen to eighteen years old residing in Los Angeles, CA. We will derive the cases in our sample population from Los Angeles based hospitals and analyze the corresponding emissions reported by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). These cases will undergo a blood draw to assess their IgE biomarker responses and compare their responses with randomly selected controls from the source population. Analytical regressions will be used to model the meaningful covariates in the relationship to estimate the true association between adolescent exposure to ozone and their IgE inflammatory response.
