#### Project Description
Diarrheal disease is a major cause of global morbidity and mortality in low and middle income countries, and one of the leading causes of enteric disease is *Campylobacter* infections. *Campylobacter* is commonly transmitted to humans through the ingestion of contaminated food and water; however, further evidence suggests animal encounters may play a substantial role in transmitting the pathogen. 

This project utilizes the dataset from Dr. Thomas Gillespieâ€™s 2017 Eco-Epidemiology of Diarrheal Disease study of rural Madagascar villages to estimate the associations between three household level ecological exposures (ownership of a sick domestic animal, contact with a wild lemur, and ingestion of wildlife meat) and *Campylobacter* infection in children five years of age and younger. This was accomplished by applying epidemiologic tools including a literature review to identify relevant risk factors, the creation of a directed acyclic graph to display the relationship between all included variables, and the generation of three generalized linear mixed effects models to estimate three distinct prevalence ratios.
