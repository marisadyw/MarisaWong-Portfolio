#### Project Description
As part of the Tropical Environmental Health (EH 590R) Coursework, my partner and I presented on Taeniasis and Cysticercosis. These two diseases are zoonotic, tape-worm transmitted diseases disproportionately affecting developing countries with poor sanitation measures.

This presentation covers:
- A description of the disease, pathogen, host(s), and life cycle
- Trends in the estimated burden of disease and characteristics of the populations most affected
- Current measures for its prevention, control, and treatment
- The existing and anticipated impact of climate change on prevention and control
