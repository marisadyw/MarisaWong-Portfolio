title: Quantitative Risk Assessment of the Fairchild Semiconductor Co. Superfund Site in San Jose, CA
work:
- Risk Assessment (EH 524)
---

#### Project Description
For a final project, my group and I conducted a risk assessment of Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation's Superfund Site in San Jose, California. The site was home to an electronics and semiconductor fabrication plant from 1977 to 1983. Sources of hazards include solvents containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as 1,1,1-TCA; TCE; 1,1-DCE; and Acetone; which were discovered in 1981 to have been released into the environment through a fractured pipeline.

This site is particularly special to me, as it has been turned into a shopping center less than 2 miles from my childhood home.

For this project, we performed EPA's risk assessment process on the site to determine whether the risks were acceptable or not. We found the risks were unacceptable, so my group developed a risk communication and risk management plan.
