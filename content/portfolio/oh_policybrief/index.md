#### Project Description
The goal of this assignment was to act as a staffer tasked with preparing a policy brief for the decision maker, addressing aims of policy analysis and policy advocacy of an environmental health topic.

I chose to write about One Health Implementation in the U.S., explored a range of options that would lead to increased One Health collaborations,  and advocated for additional funding that would be provided to federal agencies specifically for One Health work.
